# teensy-rubber-ducky

The USB Rubber Ducky is a Human Interface Device programmable with a simple scripting language allowing penetration testers to quickly and easily craft and deploy security auditing payloads that mimic human keyboard input.

This repository contains payloads and extensions for the teensy 2.0 board, i crafted this using the pw from hak5, it basically disable the windows realtimeprotection and then proceed to exec a reverse pw.
it may be a lil bit slow but you can change the delay if you have new version of the board and it also depends on the victim computer
